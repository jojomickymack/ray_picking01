# Bullet Physics Example With Ray Picking

This is from the book ['Learning Libgdx Game Development'](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/learning-libgdx-game-development-second-edition) by Suryakumar Balakrishnan Nair and Andreas Oehlke.

There aren't a ton of examples of Bullet Physics usage, and this is one of the best I've seen. Bullet Physics requires an additional native library and some jar files, they are included in the build files here.
